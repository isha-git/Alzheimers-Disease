# Alzheimers-Disease

**Introduction**
Alzheimer’s is a widespread, irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disease, with complex genetic architecture.

Previous prediction methods can be roughly divided into five types1. Methods studying protein-protein interaction networks
2. Gene functional annotations
3. Sequence-based features patterns
4. Machine learning and network topological features
5. Information about tissue-specific networks
● These methods predict associated genes or biomarkers
● Few reports on brain gene expression data

● Key goal is to seek out disease risk genes (predict candidate genes)
● Various machine learning algorithms are used to classify candidate genes as
Alzheimer’s Disease associated and unassociated.

Revealing Alzheimer’s disease genes spectrum in the whole-genome by machine
learning.

The <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29320986/">research paper</a> by Huang et al. on Revealing Alzheimer’s disease genes spectrum in the whole-genome by machine learning was used as a reference for this project.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in the above-mentioned research paper was taken from the <a href = "http://www.alzgene.org/"> AlzGene archive </a>. The featurs include number of positive and negative Alzheimer's cases in control studies and family-based studies.
